        <!--EXPLANATION OF WHAT ROLES ARE FOR-->
      <p class="homeinfo">In the gamemode conquest, you can select one of 5 roles. These are usually determined by what class the God you are playing has.</p>
      <p class="homeinfo">Roles are only relevant for the gamemode Conquest as other gamemodes you do not have to queue for a certain role.</p>
        <!-- DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE ROLES DO-->
      <h4 class="homeheader">CARRY/ADC</h4>
        <p class="homeinfo">The carry will go to the long lane on the right side of the map and will focus on farming that lane until they feel fed enough (AKA get enough gold) to go gank mid or take objectives/destroy turrets. From that point onwards, they will generally be the main consistent damage dealer on the team and will rotate anywhere there is a team fight or objective to take. Carries are typically <a href="hunter.html">hunters.</a></p>
      <h4 class ="homeheader">MID</h4>
        <p class="homeinfo">The mid will go to the middle lane of the map and farm waves of minions early on before any other class will start rotating often to take camps and objectives with the support OR jungle. Playing as a mid, late game your role provides high area damage generally and can be a game changer during team fights. As a mid laner, the God you are playing is probably quite squishy (low on health and defence) and should generally should be played safe and behind a friendly tank. Mids are typically <a href="mages.html">mages.</a></p>
      <h4 class="homeheader">SUPPORT</h4>
        <p class="homeinfo">This role generally is played to support the ADC/CARRY but later on this role rotates to whoever needs the most help at any time and ultimately their job of peeling and securing will apply to the whole team in time. Supports are not high damaging characters and instead should ultimately focus on making sure their team stays alive and secures kills. Supports are typically <a href="guardians.html">guardians.</a></p>
      <h4 class="homeheader">JUNGLER</h4>
        <p class="homeinfo">The jungler will roam the jungle and secure all camps they can. Once they are fed enough to their desire they will begin ganking all three lanes at opportune times. This role get lane minion XP whenever they can by clearing waves with the other members. The jungnler will try to rotate to different lanes because they don't want to suck XP too much from one lane, but also want to gank many lanes to create pressure everywhere. Junglers are typically <a href="assassians.html">assassians.</a></p>
      <h4 class="homeheader">SOLO</h4>
        <p class="homeinfo">In the solo lane, your job is to farm waves and eventually start rotating to mid. This role is all about sustain and trying to always have the advantage over your enemy solo. This role can dominate as warriors are generally excellent early game and will get a lot of farm. Solos are typically <a href="warriors.html">warriors.</a></p>
